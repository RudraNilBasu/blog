I finally decided to start my journey to open source contribution with KDE's [GCompris-qt](https://github.com/gcompris/GCompris-qt). It mainly uses QML and Javascript for creating the activities, and C++ for the core functionality.

Quoting from their docs, 
> GCompris is an educaional software suite comprising of numerous activities from children aged 2-10. Some of the activities are game orientated, but nonetheless still educational.

### Setting up GCompris (Building from source)

In order to build GCompris from source (for Debian/Ubuntu systems), first we need to install the dependencies: 

```
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui # Optional
sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev
```
