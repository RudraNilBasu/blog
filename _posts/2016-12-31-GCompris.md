I finally decided to start my journey to open source contribution with KDE's [GCompris-qt](https://github.com/gcompris/GCompris-qt). It mainly uses QML and Javascript for creating the activities, and C++ for the core functionality.

Quoting from their docs, 
> GCompris is an educaional software suite comprising of numerous activities from children aged 2-10. Some of the activities are game orientated, but nonetheless still educational.

### Setting up GCompris (Building from source)

In order to build GCompris from source (for Debian/Ubuntu systems), first we need to install the dependencies: 

```
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui # Optional
sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev
```

Installing Qt5 and it's libraries
```
sudo apt-get install qt5-default
sudo apt-get install qtdeclarative5-dev
sudo apt-get install qtmultimedia5-dev
sudo apt-get install libqt5svg5-dev
sudo apt-get install libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev
sudo apt-get install libqt5sensors5-dev
sudo apt-get install qml-module-qtquick-particles2
sudo apt-get install qttools5-dev-tools
```

### Compilation

GCompris uses `cmake` for compilation. Minimum version of cmake is 2.8, and the recommended version is 3.5.1

[Source Code Link](http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=gcompris.git)

Get the source code: 
```
git clone https://github.com/gcompris/GCompris-qt
```

Initialise the git submodules
```
cd gcompris
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

Download the latest version of [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2) (recommended version 5.5) and open up QtCreator. Start QtCreator and open the project file `CMakeLists.txt` at the root of the source code. Create a build, and run it via QtCreator.
