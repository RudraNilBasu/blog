# Places I visit for C++ news

This is a large collection of all the places I visit for C++ news, some of them are inspired from [this stackoverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/151974/c-blogs-that-you-regularly-follow)

* [The new official ISO C++ news and info site](https://isocpp.org/)
* [herbsutter.com](https://herbsutter.com/)
* [cpp soup](http://www.cplusplus-soup.com/)

Also, [this video from Jonathon Blow](https://youtu.be/TH9VCN6UkyQ) is interesting.
