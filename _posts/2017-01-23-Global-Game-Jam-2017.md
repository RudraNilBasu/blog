Attended my first Global Game Jam, and it was fun!

This was the first time Global Game Jam came here in Kolkata. It started off with talks on creating 3D art, monetising apps and storytelling in games.

### The Start

The themes were announced briefly after the talks, and it was _"Waves"_

We didn't know which one to settle with, so we tried creating a prototype of both of the games by dividing out team into two parts, which proved to be a *HUGE MISTAKE* from our side, as it cost us a lot of valuable time as the jam progressed.

### Progress 

After hours of prototyping and deciding, we decided to go off with the first idea. We were already behind time, and we decided to scrap the idea of making it randomly generated, and create various levels to reach the end of the level. The mechanics came up pretty quickly, while it took some time to design the levels, but it was fun nonetheless! Taking up tries to fail miserably on the levels we created was the best part of the jam.
