Let's discuss about my current setup, because why not.

Quick facts:

* Distro: Kubuntu 16.04
* Kernel version: 4.4.0-70-generic

# The Shell

I use zsh as default shell. For configuring zsh, I use the [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework to make it look (and work) way cooler. With that, I have the [Inconsolata font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) installed, to allow the [agnoster](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes#agnoster) font to work properly. For the terminal, I use terminator. With those, the results are:

As for the cow with the quote, it is something that pops up whenever a new instance of the terminal is opened. It is a simple script I wrote and attached it in the end of `~/.zshrc` (It maybe `~/.bashrc` if you are using bash instead of zsh): 

```
shuf -n 1 ~/.quotes | cowsay | lolcat
```

# The Text Editor: Vim

I have two plugins added for Vim: 
* **Vim-airlines**: A customisable plugin to add various themes in vim, which helps to improve the workflow
* **NerdTree**: To explore the files and documents via vim

I am also thinking of the adding `YouCompleteMe` plugin in Vim, for autocomplition
