In my [last weeks blog post](http://rudranilbasu.me/blog/kde/2017/05/29/Start-of-Coding-period/), I mentioned about implementation of the basic structure of the levels. The progress are listed as follows: 

* The activity consists of 10 levels as of now
* The dynamic components of the levels are added, namely: the *submarine*, the *upper and lower gates*, *ship*, *whale*, *rocks* and *the crown* along with the animations for the objects that require them
* Tutorials for the initial three levels
* Started out with basic movements of the submarine

Here is a screenshot of a level from the activity:

The thing that is **not** yet implemented:
* The UI of the controls itself. As of now, the control bar of the submarine is fixed at the bottom of the screen. As a result of this, it hides gets hidden by the bar, which is disabled on start for avoiding the same reasons. I am planning to change the overall controls of the submarine compared to the gtk+ version, but as of now haven't decided which way to go. I will start improving it once I get an idea on handling the controls which will solve the above problem along with making the controls much more intuitive

For this week, I will be working on the following:
* Player movement using engines, rudders and ballast tanks [IN PROGRESS]
* Collision detection: collision of the submarine with the ships, gates, whale, crown and the rocks [IN PROGRESS]
* crown pickup mechanism: detect pickup of the crown and open the gate likewise
* "level failed" conditions: in case of any collisions or when the time is up (gate closes in such cases)

In later blog posts, I will be discussing the implementation of the movement and collision using [Box2D](http://box2d.org/) and the codebase of the activity in general.

Well, that's it for now! If you wish to have a look at the codebase or follow it up, it is in the [gsoc_rudra_submarine](https://cgit.kde.org/gcompris.git/log/?h=gsoc_rudra_submarine) branch of [gcompris](https://cgit.kde.org/gcompris.git/). A mirror of the repository is also available on [Github](https://github.com/gcompris/GCompris-qt) ([link for the gsoc_rudra_submarine branch](https://github.com/gcompris/GCompris-qt/tree/gsoc_rudra_submarine) on Github).
