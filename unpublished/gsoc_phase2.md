### Improving layout of GCompris's Family activity

Everything was well planned for a great start for the second phase of GSoC and I anticipated everything to go smoothly since I wouldn't have any college exams to worry about. Soon enough, I was proven wrong almost immediately by an incoming health issue, which took a lot of working hours from my schedule. Anyways, I started out with the family activity along with continuing with the bug fixes and improvements on the submarine activity.
